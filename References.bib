It is the cell type, rather than a distinctive architecture, that is more strongly associated with {HPV} presence. The detection ratio is higher in tumors composed entirely or partially of cells with basaloid features. In addition, a few studies have evaluated the impact of {HPV} infection on the prognosis of patients with penile cancer.

Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid ("blue") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic ("pink") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions.},

The incidence of penile cancer is four times higher in Paraguay than in the United States or Europe. There are no adequate scientific explanations for this geographical variation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the interplay among risk factors, morphology of the primary tumor, and {HPV} status.

{METHODS}
Information on socioeconomic status, education level, habits, and sexual history was obtained in 103 Paraguayan patients with penile cancer. All patients were then treated by surgery and specimens were evaluated histopathologically.

{RESULTS}
Patients usually dwelled in rural/suburban areas (82\%), lived in poverty (75\%), had a low education level (91\%), and were heavy smokers (76\%). Phimosis (57\%), moderate/poor hygienic habits (90\%), and history of sexually-transmitted diseases (74\%) were frequently found. Patients with {\textgreater}10 lifetime female partners had an odds ratio of 3.8 (95\% {CI} 1.1, 12.6; P-trend = .03) for presenting {HPV} positive tumors when compared to patients with {\textless}6 partners. However, this trend was not significant when the number of sexual partners was adjusted for age of first coitus and antecedents of sexually-transmitted diseases. {HPV}-related tumors (found in 36\% of the samples) were characterized by a warty and/or basaloid morphology and high histological grade in most cases.

{CONCLUSIONS}
In our series, patients with penile cancer presented a distinctive epidemiological and pathological profile. These data might help explaining the geographical differences in incidence and aid in the design of strategies for cancer control in Paraguay.},

	abstract = {Histologic grade has been reported as an important pathologic parameter predictive of nodal metastases and outcome in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. There is no consensus about the criteria for grading and the proportion of anaplastic cells required to classify a tumor as high grade. The incidence and management of heterogeneous tumors (tumors harboring more than 1 histologic grade) are not well established. The purposes of this study were to present a grading model for penile cancer, to test the practicality of the system by comparing a visual ("naked-eye") estimation of the proportions of grades with a digitally guided measuring system and to determine the influence on nodal metastasis of the various proportions of grades. A total of 117 penectomy and circumcision specimens with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissections were studied and 62 heterogeneous tumors were identified (53\%). The following steps were taken: (1) design of a grading system model; (2) determination of proportions of histologic grades by naked-eye evaluation and by digital measurement; (3) evaluation of metastasis according to proportions of grades; (4) determination of the influence of site of grade 3 in nodal metastasis; (5) design of a Gleason-like scoring system; and (6) statistical evaluation. We designed a 3-tier grading system. Grade 1: well-differentiated cells, almost undistinguishable from normal squamous cells except for the presence of minimal basal/parabasal cell atypia. Grade 3: tumors predominantly composed of anaplastic cells. Grade 2: all tumors not fitting into criteria described for grade 1 or 3. A visual and digital-based (slides scanned and the corresponding areas measured with an image-editing software) proportions of grades were estimated and the metastatic rate between them were confronted using different proportions of grade 3. To evaluate the influence of site of grade 3 on nodal metastasis, we selected 20 heterogeneous tumors. We established 3 sites: superficial, at or within the main tumor and deep at front of invasion. There was no significant difference between the visual estimation and the digital measurement systems. Heterogeneous tumors comprised about half of penile squamous cell carcinomas. The majority of the heterogeneous tumors were composed of a combination of grades 2 and 3 (68\%). No statistical differences were noted in the incidence of nodal metastasis when comparing tumors with various proportions of anaplastic cells (P{\textgreater}0.10 in all cases). Metastatic rate was significantly more frequent in tumors harboring any proportion of grade 3 as compared with tumors without grade 3 (58\% vs. 14\%, P=0.04). Any proportion of grade 3 was equally associated with a significant risk of nodal metastasis. A Gleason-like system showed a correlation of higher scores and rate of nodal metastasis. No predictive advantage was found when comparing the Gleason-like model with the proposed 3-tier grading system. The proposed grading system emphasized both ends of the differentiation spectrum and was based on easily recognizable morphologic criteria. When histologically evaluating penile carcinomas, we recommend a careful search of areas of grade 3. Any focus of grade 3 should be sufficient to grade the neoplasm as a high-grade tumor.},

Loss of {BAF}250a expression has recently been reported in several tumor types. To investigate the potential correlation between {BAF}250a and various clinicopathologic parameters, we assessed the expression of {BAF}250a in archival tumor tissue specimens from 147 patients with cervical cancer and 191 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia as well as 376 matched nonadjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Messenger {RNA} expression level for {BAF}250a was decreased in cervical cancer cell lines (P = .013) and tissues (P = .010), when compared with normal cervical epithelial tissue using {SYBR} Green real-time polymerase chain reaction. {BAF}250a was also detected in nuclear fractions of {HeLa} cells and in nuclei of cervical cancer tissue samples by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. {BAF}250a expression gradually decreased in transitioning from normal to cervical carcinoma (P {\textless} .001), and this loss of expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (P = .005), tumor grade (P = .029), tumor size (P = .003), and lymph node metastasis (P = .020). In multivariate analysis, overall survival in cervical cancer was significantly reduced in cases with {BAF}250a loss (hazard ratio, 2.78 [1.01-7.63]; P = .047).

There is an association of the virus with basaloid and warty carcinomas but the reported prevalence is variable. The causes of these variations are not clear. They may be owing to geographic differences, the use of different techniques to detect {HPV}, the status of the original paraffin blocks, or to variable criteria in tumor classification. The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of {HPV} in penile {SCC} and subtypes using a sensitive technique, to investigate genotypes involved, and to search for other morphologic features associated with the virus from a series of cases from Paraguay. {HPV} detection was done by {SPF}-10 polymerase chain reaction followed by {DNA} enzyme-immunoassay and genotyping by {LIPA} 25 (version 1). Samples were tested at Catalan Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, and cross testing was carried out at the Delft Diagnostic Laboratories in The Netherlands. {HPV} was detected in 64 of 202 cases (32\%). Thirteen tumors had multiple {HPV} genotypes. Most prevalent genotypes were {HPV}-16 (46 cases), {HPV}-6 (6 cases), and {HPV}-18 (4 cases), either in single or in multiple infections. {HPV} was preferentially associated with warty-basaloid (82\%), basaloid (76\%), and warty (39\%) carcinomas and not detected in verrucous, mixed verrucous-papillary, pseudohyperplastic, and pseudoglandular {SCCs}. There was a strong association between {HPV} and higher histologic grade. Basaloid cells were more frequently found in {HPV} positive tumors (72\%) and this association was statistically significant in univariate and multivariate analyses. Cells with koilocytotic features and keratinizing squamous cells were also present but to a much lesser degree (47\% and 19\%, respectively). In summary, {HPV} was found in a third of the cases and the most common genotype was {HPV}-16. Low-risk genotypes were rarely found in single infections, representing 4 cases among all analyzed (2\%). There was an association between {HPV} presence and higher histologic grade and with basaloid, warty-basaloid, and warty carcinomas.

The donor block is a standard tissue block that may be from surgical pathology, autopsy, or research material. A morphologically representative area of interest within the donor block is identified under the microscope using a stained section (usually hematoxylin and eosin stained) on a glass slide as a guide. The tissue cores are removed from the donor and inserted into a "recipient" paraffin block usually using a custom patented instrument from Beecher Instruments. Using a precise spacing pattern, tissues are inserted at high density, with up to 1000 tissue cores in a single paraffin block. Sections from this block that are cut with a microtome are placed onto standard slides that can then be used for in situ analysis. Depending on the overall depth of tissue remaining in the donor blocks, tissue arrays can generate between 100 and 500 sections. Once constructed tissue microarrays can be used with a wide range of techniques including histochemical staining, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining, or in situ hybridization for either {DNA} or {mRNA}.

{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS}: A cohort of 67 patients diagnosed with invasive penile squamous cell carcinoma from 1987 to 2010 who had known {HPV} status were selected for study. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 67 primary penile squamous cell carcinomas, matched normal tissues and 8 lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for p53, {pmTOR}, {pERK}, p4E-{BP}1, {eIF}4E and {peIF}4E. Expression was evaluated using a semiquantitative H-score on a scale of 0 to 300.
{RESULTS}: Expression of {pmTOR}, p4E-{BP}1, {eIF}4E and {peIF}4E was increased in penile tumors compared with matched adjacent normal tissues, indicating activation of the {mTOR} signaling pathway in penile tumorigenesis. Over expression of {pmTOR}, {peIF}4E and p53 was significantly associated with lymph node disease. {peIF}4E and p53 also correlated with a poor outcome, including recurrence, metastasis or disease specific death. In contrast, {pERK} and p4E-{BP}1 were associated with lower {pT} stages. {pmTOR} and intense p53 expression was associated with {HPV} negative tumors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Activation of {mTOR} signaling may contribute to penile squamous cell carcinoma progression and aggressive behavior. Targeting {mTOR} or its downstream signaling targets, such as {peIF}4E, may be a valid therapeutic strategy.},

Mutational analysis of {ARID}1A was carried out in selected cases. Immunoreactivity was not detected (corresponding to inactivation or mutation of {ARID}1A) in 36 (3.6\%) of 995 tumors. Uterine low-grade endometrioid carcinomas showed a relatively high-frequency loss of {ARID}1A expression, as 15 (26\%) of 58 cases were negative. The other tumor that had a relatively high-frequency loss of {ARID}1A expression was gastric carcinoma (11\%). Mutational analysis showed 10 (40\%) of 25 uterine endometrioid carcinomas; none of 12 uterine serous carcinomas and none of 56 ovarian serous and mucinous carcinomas harbored somatic {ARID}1A mutations. All mutations in endometrioid carcinomas were nonsense or insertion/deletion mutations, and tumors with {ARID}1A mutations showed complete loss or clonal loss of {ARID}1A expression. In conclusion, this study is the first large-scale analysis of a wide variety of carcinomas showing that uterine low-grade endometrioid carcinoma is the predominant tumor type harboring {ARID}1A mutations and frequent loss of {ARID}1A expression. These findings suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of low-grade uterine endometrioid carcinoma is similar to that of ovarian low-grade endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma, tumors that have previously been shown to have a high-frequency loss of expression and mutation of {ARID}1A.},

Tumors with {ARID}1A mutations also frequently harbor {PTEN} or {PIK}3CA mutations, suggesting their collaboration in tumorigenesis. Here, we used a conditional knockout mouse model in which Arid1a and Pten were deleted either individually or in combination in the mouse ovarian surface epithelium. After 6 months, 59.1\% of mice with Arid1a and Pten double knockout developed ovarian endometrioid or undifferentiated carcinoma, whereas the remaining mice showed hyperplasia of ovarian surface epithelium. In contrast, 52 mice with homozygous or heterozygous deletion in either Arid1a or Pten did not develop ovarian lesions. These results demonstrate that inactivation of Arid1a alone is insufficient for tumor initiation but it requires additional genetic alteration(s) such as Pten deletion to drive tumorigenesis.},

Here we report that restoring wild-type {ARID}1A expression in ovarian cancer cells that harbor {ARID}1A mutations is sufficient to suppress cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice, whereas {RNAi}-mediated silencing of {ARID}1A in non-transformed epithelial cells is sufficient to enhance cellular proliferation and tumorigenicity.

In support of the likelihood that p53 mediates the effects of {ARID}1A on these genes, we demonstrated that p53 was required and sufficient for their regulation by {ARID}1A. Further, we showed that {CDKN}1A (encoding p21) acted in part to mediate growth suppression by {ARID}1A. Lastly, we obtained evidence that the {ARID}1A/{BRG}1 complex interacts directly with p53 and that mutations in the {ARID}1A and {TP}53 genes were mutually exclusive in tumor specimens.

This study investigated whether {ARID}1A expression was also lost in cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas.
{METHODS}: A total of 91 patients with cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Cervical carcinoma specimens were examined for {ARID}1A protein expression by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between the loss of {ARID}1A expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and prognosis were investigated.
{RESULTS}: Using immunohistochemistry, the frequency of loss of {ARID}1A expression in adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas (31.1\% [14/45]) was significantly higher than that in squamous cell carcinomas (6.5\% [3/46]; P = 0.0017).

	abstract = {Recently, the {ARID}1A gene has been identified as a novel tumor suppressor in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. The prognostic significance of the loss of {ARID}1A expression is not known. The current study was designed to evaluate whether {ARID}1A was a prognostic factor for progression, survival, and chemoresistance in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. A total of 60 patients, who were surgically treated for primary ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma, were enrolled. Surgical specimens were examined for {ARID}1A protein expression by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between the loss of {ARID}1A expression and clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, and chemosensitivity were investigated. Loss of {ARID}1A expression was identified in 9 (15.0\%) of 60 ovarian clear cell carcinoma samples. Loss of {ARID}1A staining intensity (0+) was more frequently found in cells of clear cell carcinomas than in high-grade serous carcinomas (P{\textless}0.01). Loss of {ARID}1A expression was significantly correlated with advanced {FIGO} stage and high {CA}125 levels (P=0.02, 0.01). There were no significant correlations between loss of {ARID}1A expression and patient age, status of residual tumor, Ki-67 labeling index, or the status of endometriosis. Loss of {ARID}1A correlated with shorter progression-free survival of patients with clear cell carcinomas treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (P{\textless}0.01). Loss of {ARID}1A expression tended to correlate with shorter overall survival in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinomas treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. When data were stratified for the multivariate analysis, only the loss of {ARID}1A expression remained a significant (P=0.03) predictor of reduced progression-free survival. Of the 60 patients with ovarian clear cell carcinomas, 14 patients had measurable residual tumor after primary cytoreductive surgery. Tumors with loss of {ARID}1A expression were more likely to be chemoresistant than tumors with positive {ARID}1A expression (100.0 vs 40.0\%, P=0.04). This study demonstrates that loss of {ARID}1A in ovarian clear cell carcinoma is a negative prognostic factor in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Measurement of {ARID}1A expression may be a method to predict resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Recent morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic studies have led to the development of a new paradigm for the pathogenesis and origin of epithelial ovarian cancer based on a dualistic model of carcinogenesis that divides epithelial ovarian cancer into 2 broad categories designated types I and {II}. Type I tumors comprise low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous carcinomas, and Brenner tumors. They are generally indolent, present in stage I (tumor confined to the ovary), and are characterized by specific mutations, including {KRAS}, {BRAF}, {ERBB}2, {CTNNB}1, {PTEN}, {PIK}3CA, {ARID}1A, and {PPP}2R1A, which target specific cell signaling pathways. Type I tumors rarely harbor {TP}53 mutations and are relatively stable genetically. Type {II} tumors comprise high-grade serous, high-grade endometrioid, malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (carcinosarcomas), and undifferentiated carcinomas. They are aggressive, present in advanced stage, and have a very high frequency of {TP}53 mutations but rarely harbor the mutations detected in type I tumors. In addition, type {II} tumors have molecular alterations that perturb expression of {BRCA} either by mutation of the gene or by promoter methylation. A hallmark of these tumors is that they are genetically highly unstable. Recent studies strongly suggest that fallopian tube epithelium (benign or malignant) that implants on the ovary is the source of low-grade and high-grade serous carcinoma rather than the ovarian surface epithelium as previously believed. Similarly, it is widely accepted that endometriosis is the precursor of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas and, as endometriosis, is thought to develop from retrograde menstruation; these tumors can also be regarded as involving the ovary secondarily. The origin of mucinous and transitional cell (Brenner) tumors is still not well established, although recent data suggest a possible origin from transitional epithelial nests located in paraovarian locations at the tuboperitoneal junction. Thus, it now appears that type I and type {II} ovarian tumors develop independently along different molecular pathways and that both types develop outside the ovary and involve it secondarily. If this concept is confirmed, it leads to the conclusion that the only true primary ovarian neoplasms are gonadal stromal and germ cell tumors analogous to testicular tumors. This new paradigm of ovarian carcinogenesis has important clinical implications. By shifting the early events of ovarian carcinogenesis to the fallopian tube and endometrium instead of the ovary, prevention approaches, for example, salpingectomy with ovarian conservation, may play an important role in reducing the burden of ovarian cancer while preserving hormonal function and fertility.},

They commonly result in loss of {ARID}1A-protein expression and frequently co-occur with {PI}3K/{AKT}-pathway activating mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis as to whether {PI}3K/{AKT}-pathway activation is a critical mechanism in {ARID}1A-mutated tumors and if consequently {ARID}1A-deficient tumors show increased sensitivity to treatment with {PI}3K- and {AKT}-inhibitors. Upon {ARID}1A knockdown, {MCF}7 breast cancer cells and primary {MRC}5 cells exhibited a significantly increased sensitivity towards the {AKT}-inhibitors {MK}-2206 and perifosine, as well as the {PI}3K-inhibitor buparlisib. Knockdown of {ARID}1A in {MCF}7 led to an increase of {pAKT}-Ser473. {AKT}-inhibition with {MK}-2206 led to increased apoptosis and to a decrease of {pS}6K in {ARID}1A-depleted {MCF}7 cells but not in the controls. In five {OCCC} cell lines {ARID}1A-deficiency correlated with increased {pAKT}-Ser473 levels and with sensitivity towards treatment with the {AKT}-inhibitor {MK}-2206. In conclusion, {ARID}1A-deficient cancer cells demonstrate an increased sensitivity to treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the {PI}3K/{AKT}-pathway. These findings suggest a specific requirement of the {PI}3K/{AKT} pathway in {ARID}1A-deficient tumors and reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of {ARID}1A expression and inhibition of the {PI}3K/{AKT} pathway.},

	abstract = {Background
The pathogenesis of penile squamous cell carcinoma ({PSCC}) is not well understood, though risk factors include human papillomavirus ({HPV}). Disruption of {HER}/{PTEN}/Akt pathway is present in many cancers; however there is little information on its function in {PSCC}. We investigated {HER} family receptors and phosphatase and tension homolog ({PTEN}) in {HPV}-positive and negative {PSCC} and its impact on Akt activation using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridisation ({FISH}).

Methodology/Principal Findings
148 {PSCCs} were microarrayed and immunostained for phosphorylated {EGFR} ({pEGFR}), {HER}2, {HER}3, {HER}4, phosphorylated Akt ({pAkt}), Akt1 and {PTEN} proteins. {EGFR} and {PTEN} gene status were also evaluated using {FISH}. {HPV} presence was assessed by {PCR}. {pEGFR} expression was detected significantly less frequently in {HPV}-positive than {HPV}-negative tumours (p = 0.0143). Conversely, {HER}3 expression was significantly more common in {HPV}-positive cases (p = 0.0128). {HER}4, {pAkt}, Akt and {PTEN} protein expression were not related to {HPV}. {HER}3 (p = 0.0054) and {HER}4 (p = 0.0002) receptors significantly correlated with cytoplasmic Akt1 immunostaining. All three proteins positively correlated with tumour grade ({HER}3, p = 0.0029; {HER}4, p = 0.0118; Akt1, p = 0.0001). {pEGFR} expression correlated with {pAkt} but not with tumour grade or stage. There was no {EGFR} gene amplification. {HER}2 was not detected. {PTEN} protein expression was reduced or absent in 62\% of tumours but {PTEN} gene copy loss was present only in 4\% of {PSCCs}.

Conclusions/Significance
{EGFR}, {HER}3 and {HER}4 but not {HER}2 are associated with penile carcinogenesis. {HPV}-negative tumours tend to express significantly more {pEGFR} than {HPV}-positive cancers and this expression correlates with {pAkt} protein, indicating {EGFR} as an upstream regulator of Akt signalling in {PSCC}. Conversely, {HER}3 expression is significantly more common in {HPV}-positive cases and positively correlates with cytoplasmic Akt1 expression. {HER}4 and {PTEN} protein expression are not related to {HPV} infection. Our results suggest that {PSCC} patients could benefit from therapies developed to target {HER} receptors.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: {MicroRNAs}({miRNAs}) play important roles in tumor development and progression. The purposes of this study were to investigate the role of {miR}-31 in cervical cancer and clarified the regulation of {ARID}1A by {miR}-31.
{METHODS}: Quantitative {RT}-{PCR} was used to examine {miR}-31 expression in cervical cancer cell lines and patient specimens. The clinicopathological significance of {miR}-31 upregulation was further analyzed. The {MTT}, colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays, and a xenograft model were performed. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of {miR}-31, and the results were validated in cell lines and patient specimens.
{RESULTS}: {MiR}-31 was significantly up-regulated in cervical cancer cell lines and clinical tissues. The high {miR}-31 level was significantly correlated with higher {FIGO} stage, node metastasis, vascular involvement and deep stromal invasion. Patients with high expression of {miR}-31 had poorer overall survival than patients with low expression. {MiR}-31 was an independent prognostic factor in cervical cancer in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Down-regulation of {miR}-31 impaired cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. {ARID}1A was verified as a direct target of {miR}-31, which was further confirmed by the inverse expression of {miR}-31 and {ARID}1A in patient specimens.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The newly identified {miR}-31/{ARID}1A pathway provides insight into cervical cancer progression, and may represent a novel therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Background
Ovarian cancer is now recognized as a number of distinct diseases primarily defined by histological subtype. Both clear cell ovarian carcinomas ({CCC}) and ovarian endometrioid carcinomas ({EC}) may arise from endometriosis and frequently harbor mutations in the {ARID}1A tumor suppressor gene. We studied the influence of histological subtype on protein expression with reverse phase protein array ({RPPA}) and assessed proteomic changes associated with {ARID}1A mutation/{BAF}250a expression in {EC} and {CCC}.

Methods
Immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) for {BAF}250a expression was performed on 127 chemotherapy-naive ovarian carcinomas (33 {CCC}, 29 {EC}, and 65 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas ({HGSC})). Whole tumor lysates were prepared from frozen banked tumor samples and profiled by {RPPA} using 116 antibodies. {ARID}1A mutations were identified by exome sequencing, and {PIK}3CA mutations were characterized by {MALDI}-{TOF} mass spectrometry. {SAM} (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was performed to determine differential protein expression by histological subtype and {ARID}1A mutation status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the impact of {ARID}1A mutation status/{BAF}250a expression on {AKT} phosphorylation ({pAKT}). {PIK}3CA mutation type and {PTEN} expression were included in the model. {BAF}250a knockdown was performed in 3 clear cell lines using {siRNA} to {ARID}1A.

Results
Marked differences in protein expression were observed that are driven by histotype. Compared to {HGSC}, {SAM} identified over 50 proteins that are differentially expressed in {CCC} and {EC}. These included {PI}3K/{AKT} pathway proteins, those regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, and other signaling pathways including steroid hormone signaling. Multivariate models showed that tumors with loss of {BAF}250a expression showed significantly higher levels of {AKT}-Thr308 and {AKT}-Ser473 phosphorylation (p {\textless} 0.05). In 31 {CCC} cases, {pAKT} was similarly significantly increased in tumors with {BAF}250a loss on {IHC}. Knockdown of {BAF}250a by {siRNA} in three {CCC} cell lines wild type for {ARID}1A showed no increase in either {pAKT}-Thr308 or {pAKT}-S473 suggesting that {pAKT} in tumor tissues is indirectly regulated by {BAF}250a expression.

Conclusions
Proteomic assessment of {CCC} and {EC} demonstrates remarkable differences in protein expression that are dependent on histotype, thereby further characterizing these cancers. {AKT} phosphorylation is associated with {ARID}1A/{BAF}250a deficient tumors, however in ovarian cancers the mechanism remains to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {{ARID}1A is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in {\textasciitilde}50\% of ovarian clear-cell carcinomas. This mutation is associated with loss of {ARID}1A protein expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The present study aimed at determining the timing of the loss of {ARID}1A protein expression during the development of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and assessing its relevance in correlation to {PIK}3CA gene mutations. A total of 42 clear-cell carcinoma cases with adjacent putative precursor lesions (endometriosis-associated carcinoma cases (n=28) and (clear-cell) adenofibroma-associated carcinoma cases (n=14)) were selected and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for {ARID}1A protein expression and direct genomic {DNA} sequencing of exons 9 and 20 of the {PIK}3CA gene. {ARID}1A immunoreactivity was deficient in 17 (61\%) of the 28 endometriosis-associated carcinomas and 6 (43\%) of the 14 adenofibroma-associated carcinomas. Among the precursor lesions adjacent to the 23 {ARID}1A-deficient carcinomas, 86\% of the non-atypical endometriosis (12 of 14) and 100\% of the atypical endometriosis (14 of 14), benign (3 of 3), and borderline (6 of 6) clear-cell adenofibroma components were found to be {ARID}1A deficient. In contrast, in the 19 patients with {ARID}1A-intact carcinomas, all of the adjacent precursor lesions retained {ARID}1A expression regardless of their types and cytological atypia. Analysis of 22 solitary endometrioses and 10 endometrioses distant from {ARID}1A-deficient carcinomas showed that all of these lesions were diffusely immunoreactive for {ARID}1A. Among the 42 clear-cell carcinomas, somatic mutations of {PIK}3CA were detected in 17 (40\%) tumors and majority (71\%) of these were {ARID}1A-deficient carcinomas. These results suggest that loss of {ARID}1A protein expression occurs as a very early event in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma development, similar to the pattern of {PIK}3CA mutation recently reported by our group, and frequently coexists (not mutually exclusive) with {PIK}3CA mutations.},

	abstract = {Objective
Loss of {ARID}1A is related to oncogenic transformation of ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma. The present study was conducted in epithelial ovarian cancer of all tissue types to investigate whether an increased or decreased expression level of {ARID}1A can be a prognostic factor for ovarian cancer or can influence the sensitivity to anticancer drugs.

Methods
The expression level of {ARID}1A was investigated in 111 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who received initial treatment at the Hirosaki University Hospital between 2006 and 2011. The expression level of {ARID}1A was immunohistochemically graded using staining scores, which were calculated by multiplying the staining intensity of the nuclei by the stain-positive area.

Results
The level of {ARID}1A was significantly lower in clear cell adenocarcinoma than in other histologic types. Among the patients with stage {III}, {IV} cancer (n=46), the level of {ARID}1A was significantly lower (p=0.026) in patients who did not achieve complete response ({CR}; n=12) than in patients who achieved {CR} (n=34). The level of {ARID}1A was relatively lower (p=0.07) in patients who relapsed after achieving {CR} (n=21) than in patients who did not relapse (n=13). When the staining score of 0 was defined as {ARID}1A-negative and other staining scores were defined as {ARID}1A-positive, there was significant difference in progression-free survival between {ARID}1A-negative (n=11) and {ARID}1A-positive (n=35) patients in stage {III}, {IV} disease.

Conclusion
The result suggests that decreased {ARID}1A expression is correlated with chemoresistance and may be a predictive factor for the risk of relapse of advanced cancer after achieving {CR}.},

	abstract = {Gastric cancer is a major cause of global cancer mortality. We surveyed the spectrum of somatic alterations in gastric cancer by sequencing the exomes of 15 gastric adenocarcinomas and their matched normal {DNAs}. Frequently mutated genes in the adenocarcinomas included {TP}53 (11/15 tumors), {PIK}3CA (3/15) and {ARID}1A (3/15). Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological pathway among the frequently mutated genes. A prevalence screening confirmed mutations in {FAT}4, a cadherin family gene, in 5\% of gastric cancers (6/110) and {FAT}4 genomic deletions in 4\% (3/83) of gastric tumors. Frequent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes ({ARID}1A, {MLL}3 and {MLL}) also occurred in 47\% of the gastric cancers. We detected {ARID}1A mutations in 8\% of tumors (9/110), which were associated with concurrent {PIK}3CA mutations and microsatellite instability. In functional assays, we observed both {FAT}4 and {ARID}1A to exert tumor-suppressor activity. Somatic inactivation of {FAT}4 and {ARID}1A may thus be key tumorigenic events in a subset of gastric cancers.},
